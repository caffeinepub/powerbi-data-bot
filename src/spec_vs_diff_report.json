  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements with a solid foundation. The backend data model (REQ-1) is implemented with data sources, bot configs, and queries. Backend query functions (REQ-2) are structurally present but lack actual data processing logic. The frontend includes a dashboard with visualizations (REQ-3), a chat interface (REQ-4), and data upload functionality (REQ-5). The visual theme (REQ-6) uses the specified color palette. However, some acceptance criteria are partially met: backend query processing generates mock/random data rather than real pattern analysis, data validation on upload is minimal, and bot responses are simulated rather than data-driven.",
